I'm a PhD candidate at UC Davis in the Physics and Astro department. My work is primarily in the nanophotonics for quantum information technologies space. In particular, I'm concerned with the scalability issues we face as a community. As such, I'm working on novel instrumentation techniques like ICECAP, and characterizing telecom compatible color center-integrated nanophotonics that are fabricated using scalable techniques.

I deeply care about teaching effectively and equitably, so I look to use research-backed pedagogical techniques like active learning and rubric-based evaluation in my teaching work whenever possible. My teaching experience includes co-lecturing a graduate topics course about quantum information technologies in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis, and TAing several courses in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

In a similar vein, I also strongly believe in the necessity of effective science communication to broader communities. When writing news and views-type articles, I focus on digesting highly specialized language and writing a piece that is comprehensible to the general physical sciences community. Communicating to a broader academic community comes up when participating in events like the University of California Grad Slam. Finally, the most vital application of science communication, and potentially the most fun, is relating concepts to the general public. I love describing my work or associated work to the general public at events like Astro on Tap. Please contact me if you'd like me to give a talk to your community!
